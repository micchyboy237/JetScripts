# Jupyter Code Executor

AutoGen is able to execute code in a stateful Jupyter kernel, this is in contrast to the command line code executor where each code block is executed in a new process. This means that you can define variables in one code block and use them in another. One of the interesting properties of this is that when an error is encountered, only the failing code needs to be re-executed, and not the entire script.

To use the [`JupyterCodeExecutor`](/docs/reference/coding/jupyter/jupyter_code_executor#jupytercodeexecutor) you need a Jupyter server running. This can be in Docker, local, or even a remote server. Then, when constructing the [`JupyterCodeExecutor`](/docs/reference/coding/jupyter/jupyter_code_executor#jupytercodeexecutor) you pass it the server it should connect to.

## Dependencies

In order to use Jupyter based code execution some extra dependencies are required. These can be installed with the extra `jupyter-executor`:

```bash
pip install 'pyautogen[jupyter-executor]'
```

## Jupyter Server

### Docker

To run a Docker based Jupyter server, the [`DockerJupyterServer`](/docs/reference/coding/jupyter/docker_jupyter_server#dockerjupyterserver) can be used.

#### Custom Docker Image

A custom image can be used by passing the `custom_image_name` parameter to the [`DockerJupyterServer`](/docs/reference/coding/jupyter/docker_jupyter_server#dockerjupyterserver) constructor. There are some requirements of the image for it to work correctly:

- The image must have [Jupyer Kernel Gateway](https://jupyter-kernel-gateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) installed and running on port 8888 for the [`JupyterCodeExecutor`](/docs/reference/coding/jupyter/jupyter_code_executor) to be able to connect to it.
- Respect the `TOKEN` environment variable, which is used to authenticate the [`JupyterCodeExecutor`](/docs/reference/coding/jupyter/jupyter_code_executor) with the Jupyter server.
- Ensure the `jupyter kernelgateway` is started with:
    - `--JupyterApp.answer_yes=true` - this ensures that the kernel gateway does not prompt for confirmation when shut down.
    - `--JupyterWebsocketPersonality.list_kernels=true` - this ensures that the kernel gateway lists the available kernels.


If you wanted to add extra dependencies (for example `matplotlib` and `numpy`) to this image you could customize the Dockerfile like so:

```Dockerfile
FROM quay.io/jupyter/docker-stacks-foundation

SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-o", "pipefail", "-c"]

USER ${NB_UID}
RUN mamba install --yes jupyter_kernel_gateway ipykernel matplotlib numpy &&
    mamba clean --all -f -y &&
    fix-permissions "${CONDA_DIR}" &&
    fix-permissions "/home/${NB_USER}"

ENV TOKEN="UNSET"
CMD python -m jupyter kernelgateway \
    --KernelGatewayApp.ip=0.0.0.0 \
    --KernelGatewayApp.port=8888 \
    --KernelGatewayApp.auth_token="${TOKEN}" \
    --JupyterApp.answer_yes=true \
    --JupyterWebsocketPersonality.list_kernels=true

EXPOSE 8888

WORKDIR "${HOME}"
```

        )
    )

"""
### Remote

The [`JupyterCodeExecutor`](/docs/reference/coding/jupyter/jupyter_code_executor) can also connect to a remote Jupyter server. This is done by passing connection information rather than an actual server object into the [`JupyterCodeExecutor`](/docs/reference/coding/jupyter/jupyter_code_executor) constructor.

```python

executor = JupyterCodeExecutor(
    jupyter_server=JupyterConnectionInfo(host='example.com', use_https=True, port=7893, token='mytoken')
)
```

## Image outputs

When Jupyter outputs an image, this is saved as a file into the `output_dir` of the [`JupyterCodeExecutor`](/docs/reference/coding/jupyter/jupyter_code_executor), as specified by the constructor. By default this is the current working directory.

## Assigning to an agent

A single server can support multiple agents, as each executor will create its own kernel. To assign an executor to an agent it can be done like so:
"""
logger.info("### Remote")



server = DockerJupyterServer()

output_dir = Path("coding")
output_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

code_executor_agent = ConversableAgent(
    name="code_executor_agent",
    llm_config=False,
    code_execution_config={
        "executor": JupyterCodeExecutor(server, output_dir=output_dir),
    },
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
)

"""
When using code execution it is critical that you update the system prompt of agents you expect to write code to be able to make use of the executor. For example, for the [`JupyterCodeExecutor`](/docs/reference/coding/jupyter/jupyter_code_executor) you might setup a code writing agent like so:
"""
