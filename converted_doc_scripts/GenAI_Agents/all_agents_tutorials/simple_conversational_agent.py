# Building a Conversational Agent with Context Awareness

## Overview
This tutorial outlines the process of creating a conversational agent that maintains context across multiple interactions. We'll use a modern AI framework to build an agent capable of engaging in more natural and coherent conversations.

## Motivation
Many simple chatbots lack the ability to maintain context, leading to disjointed and frustrating user experiences. This tutorial aims to solve that problem by implementing a conversational agent that can remember and refer to previous parts of the conversation, enhancing the overall interaction quality.

## Key Components
1. **Language Model**: The core AI component that generates responses.
2. **Prompt Template**: Defines the structure of our conversations.
3. **History Manager**: Manages conversation history and context.
4. **Message Store**: Stores the messages for each conversation session.

## Method Details

### Setting Up the Environment
Begin by setting up the necessary AI framework and ensuring access to a suitable language model. This forms the foundation of our conversational agent.

### Creating the Chat History Store
Implement a system to manage multiple conversation sessions. Each session should be uniquely identifiable and associated with its own message history.

### Defining the Conversation Structure
Create a template that includes:
- A system message defining the AI's role
- A placeholder for conversation history
- The user's input

This structure guides the AI's responses and maintains consistency throughout the conversation.

### Building the Conversational Chain
Combine the prompt template with the language model to create a basic conversational chain. Wrap this chain with a history management component that automatically handles the insertion and retrieval of conversation history.

### Interacting with the Agent
To use the agent, invoke it with a user input and a session identifier. The history manager takes care of retrieving the appropriate conversation history, inserting it into the prompt, and storing new messages after each interaction.

## Conclusion
This approach to creating a conversational agent offers several advantages:
- **Context Awareness**: The agent can refer to previous parts of the conversation, leading to more natural interactions.
- **Simplicity**: The modular design keeps the implementation straightforward.
- **Flexibility**: It's easy to modify the conversation structure or switch to a different language model.
- **Scalability**: The session-based approach allows for managing multiple independent conversations.

With this foundation, you can further enhance the agent by:
- Implementing more sophisticated prompt engineering
- Integrating it with external knowledge bases
- Adding specialized capabilities for specific domains
- Incorporating error handling and conversation repair strategies

By focusing on context management, this conversational agent design significantly improves upon basic chatbot functionality, paving the way for more engaging and helpful AI assistants.
