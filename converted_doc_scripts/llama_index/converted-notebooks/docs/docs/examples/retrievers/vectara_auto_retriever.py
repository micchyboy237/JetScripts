# Auto-Retrieval from a Vectara Index

This guide shows how to perform **auto-retrieval** in LlamaIndex with Vectara. 

With Auto-retrieval we interpret a retrieval query before submitting it to Vectara to identify potential rewrites of the query as a shorter query along with some metadata filtering.

For example, a query like "what is the revenue in 2022" might be rewritten as "what is the revenue" along with a filter of "doc.year = 2022". Let's see how this works via an example.

## Setup

If you're opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.

## Defining Some Sample Data

We first define a dataset of movies:
1. Each node describes a movie.
2. The `text` describes the movie, whereas `metadata` defines certain metadata fields like year, director, rating or genre.

In Vectara you will need to [define](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/metadata-search-filtering/filter-overview) these metadata fields in your coprus as filterable attributes so that filtering can occur with them.
