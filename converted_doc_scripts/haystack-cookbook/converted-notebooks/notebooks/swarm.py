# 🐝🐝🐝 Create a Swarm of Agents

> As of Haystack 2.9.0, experimental dataclasses (refactored ChatMessage and ChatRole, ToolCall and Tool) and components (refactored OpenAIChatGenerator, ToolInvoker) are removed from the `haystack-experimental` and merged into Haystack core.

Ollama recently released Swarm: an educational framework that proposes lightweight techniques for creating and orchestrating multi-agent systems.


In this notebook, we'll explore the core concepts of Swarm ([Routines and Handoffs](https://cookbook.ollama.com/examples/orchestrating_agents)) and implement them using Haystack and its tool support.

This exploration is not only educational: we will unlock features missing in the original implementation, like the ability of using models from various providers. In fact, our final example will include 3 agents: one powered by llama3.2 (Ollama), one using Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Ollama) and a third running Llama-3.2-3B locally via Ollama.

## Setup

We install the required dependencies. In addition to Haystack, we also need integrations with Ollama and Ollama.

Let's say it tried to do its best 😀

## Tools and Routines

The term Agent has a broad definition. 

However, to qualify as an Agent, a software application built on a Language Model should go beyond simply generating text; it must also be capable of performing actions, such as executing functions.

A popular way of doing this is **Tool calling**:
1. We provide a set of tools (functions, APIs with a given spec) to the model.
2. The model prepares function calls based on user request and available tools.
3. Actual invocation is executed outside the model (at the Agent level).
4. The model can further elaborate on the result of the invocation.

For information on tool support in Haystack, check out the [documentation](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/tool).

Swarm introduces **routines**, which are natural-language instructions paired with the tools needed to execute them. Below, we’ll build an agent capable of calling tools and executing routines.


### Implementation

- `instructions` could already be passed to the Assistant, to guide its behavior.

- The Agent introduces a new init parameter called `functions`. These functions are automatically converted into Tools. Key difference: to be passed to a Language Model, a Tool must have a name, a description and JSON schema specifying its parameters.

- During initialization, we also create a `ToolInvoker`. This Haystack component takes in Chat Messages containing prepared `tool_calls`, performs the tool invocation and wraps the results in Chat Message with `tool` role.

- What happens during `run`? The agent first generates a response. If the response includes tool calls, these are executed, and the results are integrated into the conversation.

- The `while` loop manages user interactions:
  - If the last message role is `assistant`, it waits for user input.
  - If the last message role is `tool`, it continues running to handle tool execution and its responses.

*Note: This implementation differs from the original approach by making the Agent responsible for invoking tools directly, instead of delegating control to the `while` loop.*

Promising!

## Handoff: switching control between Agents

The most interesting idea of Swarm is probably handoffs: enabling one Agent to transfer control to another with Tool calling. 

**How it works**
1. Add specific handoff functions to the Agent's available tools, allowing it to transfer control when needed.
2. Modify the Agent to return the name of the next agent along with its messages.
3. Handle the switch in  `while` loop.

*The implementation is similar to the previous one, but, compared to `ToolCallingAgent`, a `SwarmAgent` also returns the name of the next agent to be called, enabling handoffs.*

# A more complex multi-agent system

Now, we move on to a more intricate multi-agent system that simulates a customer service setup for ACME Corporation, a fictional entity from the Road Runner/Wile E. Coyote cartoons, which sells quirky products meant to catch roadrunners.
(We are reimplementing the example from the original article by Ollama.)


This system involves several different agents (each with specific tools):
- Triage Agent: handles general questions and directs to other agents. Tools: `transfer_to_sales_agent`, `transfer_to_issues_and_repairs` and `escalate_to_human`.
- Sales Agent: proposes and sells products to the user, it can execute the order or redirect the user back to the Triage Agent. Tools: `execute_order` and `transfer_back_to_triage`.
- Issues and Repairs Agent: supports customers with their problems, it can look up item IDs, execute refund or redirect the user back to triage. Tools: `look_up_item`,  `execute_refund`, and `transfer_back_to_triage`.

A nice bonus feature of our implementation is that **we can use different model providers** supported by Haystack. In this case, the Triage Agent is powered by (Ollama) llama3.2, while we use (Ollama) Claude 3.5 Sonnet for the other two agents.

As demonstrated, our implementation is model-provider agnostic, meaning it can work with both proprietary models and open models running locally.

In practice, you can have Agents that handle complex tasks using powerful proprietary models, and other Agents that perform simpler tasks using smaller open models.

In our example, we will use Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, a small model with impressive instruction following capabilities (high IFEval score). We'll use **Ollama** to host and serve this model.

### Install and run Ollama

In conclusion, we have built a multi-agent system using Swarm concepts and Haystack tools, demonstrating how to integrate models from different providers, including a local model running on Ollama.

Swarm ideas are pretty simple and useful for several use cases and the abstractions provided by Haystack make it easy to implement them.
However, this architecture may not be the best fit for all use cases: memory is handled as a list of messages; this system only runs one Agent at a time.

Looking ahead, we plan to develop and showcase more advanced Agents with Haystack. Stay tuned! 📻
