# RAG pipeline evaluation using Ragas

[Ragas](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/) is an open source framework for model-based evaluation to evaluate your [Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://www.deepset.ai/blog/llms-retrieval-augmentation) (RAG) pipelines and LLM applications.
It supports metrics like correctness, tone, hallucination (faithfulness), fluency, and more.

For more information about evaluators, supported metrics and usage, check out:

* [RagasEvaluator](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/ragasevaluator)
* [Model based evaluation](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/model-based-evaluation)

This notebook shows how to use the [Ragas-Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/integrations/ragas) integration to evaluate a RAG pipeline against various metrics.

## Prerequisites:

- **Ragas** uses [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) key for computing some metrics, so we need an Ollama API key.

#### Initializing RAG Pipeline Components
This section sets up the essential components required to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. These components include a Document Store for managing and storing documents, an Embedder for generating embeddings to enable similarity-based retrieval, and a Retriever for fetching relevant documents. Additionally, a Prompt Template is designed to structure the pipeline's input, while a Chat Generator handles response generation.

Pass all the Ragas metrics you want to use for evaluation, ensuring that all the necessary information to calculate each selected metric is provided.

For example:

- **AnswerRelevancy**: requires both the **query** and the **response**. It does not consider factuality but instead assigns lower score to cases where the response lacks completeness or contains redundant details.
- **ContextPrecision**: requires the **query**, **retrieved documents**, and the **reference**. It evaluates to what extent the retrieved documents contain precisely only what is relevant to answer the query.
- **Faithfulness**: requires the **query**, **retrieved documents**, and the **response**. The response is regarded as faithful if all the claims that are made in the response can be inferred from the retrieved documents.

Make sure to include all relevant data for each metric to ensure accurate evaluation.
