# Getting Started with LlamaFirewall
## Introduction

Welcome to this basic tutorial on LlamaFirewall! If you're new to AI security and want to understand how to protect your AI applications, you're in the right place. This tutorial will introduce you to LlamaFirewall's basic message scanning capabilities through simple, practical examples.
 
In this beginner-friendly guide, we'll cover:
- How to scan messages for potential security threats
- What the scan results mean (including scores, decisions, and reasons)
 
 We'll start with the basics and use straightforward examples to demonstrate these concepts. Whether you're a developer just getting started with AI security or someone looking to understand LlamaFirewall's fundamentals, this tutorial will help you grasp the essential concepts. Let's begin!

First, We need to enable nested async support. This allows us to run async code within sync code blocks, which is needed for some LlamaFirewall operations.

## Understanding Scan Results

The scan results include:
- `score`: A numerical value indicating the severity of potential issues
- `decision`: The final decision, which can be:
  - `block`: Content is blocked due to detected issues
  - `allow`: Content is safe to proceed
  - `human_in_the_loop_required`: Content needs human review before proceeding
- `reason`: A detailed explanation of why the decision was made
