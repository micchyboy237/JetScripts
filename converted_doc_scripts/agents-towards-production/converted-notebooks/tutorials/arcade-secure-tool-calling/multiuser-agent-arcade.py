# Secure tool calling with Arcade.dev

This tutorial will help you close one of the biggest gaps between demo and production agents: __Secure tool-calling__

When your agents work well in your computer, they are excellent personal assistants, but scaling that up to many users is not easy, as the security assumptions from a local deployment do not apply to agents at scale. Personal Access Tokens simply won't cut it for multiple users. Even if you encapsulate all of the functionality in a remote MCP server, tool-level auth will require you to implement the auth flow for all the providers that your agent relies on.

Arcade solves this by providing a unified platform for agentic tool execution. It will handle the auth flow for you offering a secure multi-user solution for your agents.

In this tutorial you'll learn how to use Arcade and LangGraph to
- Build agents
- Give tools that can interact with
    - GMail
    - Slack
    - Notion
- Implement safety guardrails when calling specific tools (Human-in-the-Loop)

# Setup the environment

Before getting into the code, let's setup our development environment with the right dependencies

---

## System Flow
Here’s how a simple chatbot grows into a robust multi-user system with full safety controls:

```

## Development Environment Setup

Before implementing our multi-user agent system, we need to establish a proper development environment with the necessary dependencies. The following installation includes LangGraph for agent orchestration, LangChain-Arcade for tool integration, and the core LangChain library with Ollama support.
"""
logger.info("# Secure tool calling with Arcade.dev")

# !pip install langgraph langchain-arcade "langchain[ollama]"

"""
## API Key Configuration

Our tutorial requires two essential API keys for operation. You will need an [Ollama API](https://platform.ollama.com/signup) key, as well as an [Arcade API](https://api.arcade.dev/signup?utm_source=github&utm_medium=notebook&utm_campaign=nir_diamant&utm_content=tutorial) key for this tutorial. Both services offer straightforward registration processes, with Arcade specifically designed to simplify the integration of external tools into AI applications.
"""
logger.info("## API Key Configuration")

# import getpass

def _set_env(key: str, default: str | None):
    if key not in os.environ:
        if default:
            os.environ[key] = default
        else:
#             os.environ[key] = getpass.getpass(f"{key}:")


# _set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")
_set_env("ARCADE_API_KEY")

"""
## User Identity Configuration

The Arcade platform requires user identification to properly manage tool authorizations and maintain security boundaries between different users. This identifier must correspond to the email address used during Arcade account creation, ensuring that tool permissions and OAuth tokens are correctly associated with the appropriate user account.
"""
logger.info("## User Identity Configuration")

_set_env("ARCADE_USER_ID")

"""
# Simple Conversational Agent

We begin our journey by implementing a basic conversational agent that demonstrates core LangGraph functionality without external tool dependencies. This foundational agent provides conversational capabilities with short-term memory, allowing it to maintain context throughout a conversation while establishing the architectural patterns we'll extend throughout this tutorial.

## Core Agent Implementation

The following implementation creates a React-style agent using [LangGraph and Arcade](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/langchain/use-arcade-tools#create-a-react-style-agent?utm_source=github&utm_medium=notebook&utm_campaign=nir_diamant&utm_content=tutorial). We configure it with conversation memory through a MemorySaver checkpointer, enabling the agent to remember previous interactions within the same conversation thread. The agent receives a clear prompt defining its helpful and concise personality, along with instructions for handling unclear requests.
"""
logger.info("# Simple Conversational Agent")


checkpointer = MemorySaver()

agent_a = create_react_agent(
    model="ollama:gpt-5",
    prompt="You are a helpful assistant that can help with everyday tasks."
           " If the user's request is confusing you must ask them to clarify"
           " their intent, and fulfill the instruction to the best of your"
           " ability. Be concise and friendly at all times.",
    tools=[], # no tools for now!
    checkpointer=checkpointer
)

"""
## Agent Interaction Utility

To facilitate consistent interaction with our agents throughout this tutorial, we implement a utility function that streams agent responses and displays them in a readable format. This function processes the graph's streaming output and presents the latest message from each interaction cycle, providing immediate feedback during agent conversations.
"""
logger.info("## Agent Interaction Utility")

def run_graph(graph: CompiledStateGraph, config, input):
    for event in graph.stream(input, config=config, stream_mode="values"):
        if "messages" in event:
            event["messages"][-1].pretty_logger.debug()

"""
## Interactive Chat Interface

The following implementation provides a complete interactive chat interface for testing our basic agent. The system generates a unique conversation thread identifier for each session, enabling memory persistence across multiple exchanges within the same conversation. Users can engage naturally with the agent and terminate the session by typing "exit".
"""
logger.info("## Interactive Chat Interface")

config = {
    "configurable": {
        "thread_id": uuid.uuid4()

        break

    user_message = {"messages": [HumanMessage(content=user_input)]}
    run_graph(agent_a, config, user_message)

"""
## Testing Agent Limitations

To understand the boundaries of our basic agent, we'll test it with requests that require external data access. The following test demonstrates the agent's inability to provide current date information, as most language models lack real-time data access and may provide outdated or inaccurate temporal information.
"""

user_message = {"messages": [HumanMessage(content=prompt)]}
run_graph(agent_a, config, user_message)

"""
## Demonstrating Authentication Requirements

The following test illustrates the agent's complete inability to access private, authenticated data sources. When asked to summarize personal emails, the agent cannot proceed without proper authentication mechanisms and authorized access to external services. This limitation highlights the critical need for secure tool integration in production agent systems.

# Tool Integration with Secure Authentication

Having established our basic agent architecture, we now address the core challenge of enabling secure access to external services. This section demonstrates how Arcade.dev solves the complex problem of tool-level authentication, providing a streamlined approach to OAuth integration that scales across multiple users and services.

## Arcade Client Initialization

We begin by establishing connections to the Arcade platform through both the core client and the LangChain integration layer. The ToolManager serves as our primary interface for configuring and authorizing tools, while the Arcade client handles the underlying authentication infrastructure.

"""
## Gmail Tool Configuration

Our first tool integration focuses on Gmail access, specifically the email listing capability that our basic agent could not provide. The Gmail_ListEmails tool enables our agent to retrieve and analyze email data, but requires proper user authorization before it can access private email accounts.
"""
logger.info("## Gmail Tool Configuration")

gmail_tool = manager.init_tools(tools=["Gmail_ListEmails"])[0]

"""
## Authorization Utility Function

To streamline the authorization process throughout this tutorial, we implement a reusable function that handles OAuth flow initiation and completion. For reading our email, however, we need to give our app permissions to read it in a secure way. Arcade lets us do this easily by [handling the OAuth2 for us](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/how-arcade-helps?utm_source=github&utm_medium=notebook&utm_campaign=nir_diamant&utm_content=tutorial). This function checks the current authorization status for a specific tool and user combination, initiating the OAuth process when necessary and waiting for user completion of the authorization flow.

Managing multiple tool authorizations individually becomes cumbersome as our agent's capabilities expand. This requires [initializing multiple tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/faq#can-i-authenticate-multiple-tools-at-once?utm_source=github&utm_medium=notebook&utm_campaign=nir_diamant&utm_content=tutorial) for the agent, and authenticating the scope of each tool.
