# SalesGPT - Context-Aware AI Sales Assistant With Knowledge Base and Ability Generate Stripe Payment Links

This notebook demonstrates an implementation of a **Context-Aware** AI Sales agent with a Product Knowledge Base which can actually close sales. 

This notebook was originally published at [filipmichalsky/SalesGPT](https://github.com/filip-michalsky/SalesGPT) by [@FilipMichalsky](https://twitter.com/FilipMichalsky).

SalesGPT is context-aware, which means it can understand what section of a sales conversation it is in and act accordingly.
 
As such, this agent can have a natural sales conversation with a prospect and behaves based on the conversation stage. Hence, this notebook demonstrates how we can use AI to automate sales development representatives activites, such as outbound sales calls. 

Additionally, the AI Sales agent has access to tools, which allow it to interact with other systems.

Here, we show how the AI Sales Agent can use a **Product Knowledge Base** to speak about a particular's company offerings,
hence increasing relevance and reducing hallucinations.

Furthermore, we show how our AI Sales Agent can **generate sales** by integration with the AI Agent Highway called [Mindware](https://www.mindware.co/). In practice, this allows the agent to autonomously generate a payment link for your customers **to pay for your products via Stripe**.

We leverage the [`langchain`](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) library in this implementation, specifically [Custom Agent Configuration](https://langchain-langchain.vercel.app/docs/modules/agents/how_to/custom_agent_with_tool_retrieval) and are inspired by [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) architecture .

### SalesGPT architecture

1. Seed the SalesGPT agent
2. Run Sales Agent to decide what to do:

    a) Use a tool, such as look up Product Information in a Knowledge Base or Generate a Payment Link
    
    b) Output a response to a user 
3. Run Sales Stage Recognition Agent to recognize which stage is the sales agent at and adjust their behaviour accordingly.

Here is the schematic of the architecture:

### Architecture diagram

<img src="https://demo-bucket-45.s3.amazonaws.com/new_flow2.png"  width="800" height="440">

### Sales conversation stages.

The agent employs an assistant who keeps it in check as in what stage of the conversation it is in. These stages were generated by ChatGPT and can be easily modified to fit other use cases or modes of conversation.

1. Introduction: Start the conversation by introducing yourself and your company. Be polite and respectful while keeping the tone of the conversation professional.

2. Qualification: Qualify the prospect by confirming if they are the right person to talk to regarding your product/service. Ensure that they have the authority to make purchasing decisions.

3. Value proposition: Briefly explain how your product/service can benefit the prospect. Focus on the unique selling points and value proposition of your product/service that sets it apart from competitors.

4. Needs analysis: Ask open-ended questions to uncover the prospect's needs and pain points. Listen carefully to their responses and take notes.

5. Solution presentation: Based on the prospect's needs, present your product/service as the solution that can address their pain points.

6. Objection handling: Address any objections that the prospect may have regarding your product/service. Be prepared to provide evidence or testimonials to support your claims.

7. Close: Ask for the sale by proposing a next step. This could be a demo, a trial or a meeting with decision-makers. Ensure to summarize what has been discussed and reiterate the benefits.

TOOLS:
------

{salesperson_name} has access to the following tools:

{tools}

To use a tool, please use the following format:

```
Thought: Do I need to use a tool? Yes
Action: the action to take, should be one of {tools}
Action Input: the input to the action, always a simple string input
Observation: the result of the action
```

If the result of the action is "I don't know." or "Sorry I don't know", then you have to say that to the user as described in the next sentence.
When you have a response to say to the Human, or if you do not need to use a tool, or if tool did not help, you MUST use the format:

```
Thought: Do I need to use a tool? No
{salesperson_name}: [your response here, if previously used a tool, rephrase latest observation, if unable to find the answer, say it]
