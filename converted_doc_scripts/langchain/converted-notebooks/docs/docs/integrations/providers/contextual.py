# Contextual AI

Contextual AI provides state-of-the-art RAG components designed specifically for accurate and reliable enterprise AI applications. Our LangChain integration exposes standalone API endpoints for our specialized models:

- Grounded Language Model (GLM): The world's most grounded language model, engineered to minimize hallucinations by prioritizing faithfulness to retrieved knowledge. GLM delivers exceptional factual accuracy with inline attributions, making it ideal for enterprise RAG and agentic applications where reliability is critical.

- Instruction-Following Reranker: The first reranker that follows custom instructions to intelligently prioritize documents based on specific criteria like recency, source, or document type. Outperforming competitors on industry benchmarks, our reranker resolves conflicting information challenges in enterprise knowledge bases.

Founded by the inventors of RAG technology, Contextual AI's specialized components help innovative teams accelerate the development of production-ready RAG agents that deliver responses with exceptional accuracy.

## Grounded Language Model (GLM)

The Grounded Language Model (GLM) is engineered specifically to minimize hallucinations in enterprise RAG and agentic applications. The GLM delivers:

- Strong performance with 88% factual accuracy on the FACTS benchmark ([See benchmark results](https://venturebeat.com/ai/contextual-ais-new-ai-model-crushes-gpt-4o-in-accuracy-heres-why-it-matters/))
- Responses strictly grounded in provided knowledge sources with inline attributions ([Read product details](https://contextual.ai/blog/introducing-grounded-language-model/))
- Precise source citations integrated directly within generated responses
- Prioritization of retrieved context over parametric knowledge ([View technical overview](https://contextual.ai/blog/platform-benchmarks-2025/))
- Clear acknowledgment of uncertainty when information is unavailable

GLM serves as a drop-in replacement for general-purpose LLMs in RAG pipelines, dramatically improving reliability for mission-critical enterprise applications.

## Instruction-Following Reranker

The world's first Instruction-Following Reranker revolutionizes document ranking with unprecedented control and accuracy. Key capabilities include:

- Natural language instructions to prioritize documents based on recency, source, metadata, and more ([See how it works](https://contextual.ai/blog/introducing-instruction-following-reranker/))
- Superior performance on the BEIR benchmark with a score of 61.2, outperforming competitors by significant margins ([View benchmark data](https://contextual.ai/blog/platform-benchmarks-2025/))
- Intelligent resolution of conflicting information from multiple knowledge sources
- Seamless integration as a drop-in replacement for existing rerankers
- Dynamic control over document ranking through natural language commands

The reranker excels at handling enterprise knowledge bases with potentially contradictory information, allowing you to specify exactly which sources should take precedence in various scenarios.

## Using Contextual AI with LangChain

See details [here](/docs/integrations/chat/contextual).

This integration allows you to easily incorporate Contextual AI's GLM and Instruction-Following Reranker into your LangChain workflows. The GLM ensures your applications deliver strictly grounded responses, while the reranker significantly improves retrieval quality by intelligently prioritizing the most relevant documents.

Whether you're building applications for regulated industries or security-conscious environments, Contextual AI provides the accuracy, control, and reliability your enterprise use cases demand.
