# IPEX-LLM

> [IPEX-LLM](https://github.com/intel-analytics/ipex-llm) is a PyTorch library for running LLM on Intel CPU and GPU (e.g., local PC with iGPU, discrete GPU such as Arc, Flex and Max) with very low latency.

- [IPEX-LLM on Intel GPU](#ipex-llm-on-intel-gpu)
- [IPEX-LLM on Intel CPU](#ipex-llm-on-intel-cpu)

## IPEX-LLM on Intel GPU

This example goes over how to use LangChain to interact with `ipex-llm` for text generation on Intel GPU. 

> **Note**
>
> It is recommended that only Windows users with Intel Arc A-Series GPU (except for Intel Arc A300-Series or Pro A60) run Jupyter notebook directly for section "IPEX-LLM on Intel GPU". For other cases (e.g. Linux users, Intel iGPU, etc.), it is recommended to run the code with Python scripts in terminal for best experiences.

### Install Prerequisites
To benefit from IPEX-LLM on Intel GPUs, there are several prerequisite steps for tools installation and environment preparation.

If you are a Windows user, visit the [Install IPEX-LLM on Windows with Intel GPU Guide](https://github.com/intel-analytics/ipex-llm/blob/main/docs/mddocs/Quickstart/install_windows_gpu.md), and follow [Install Prerequisites](https://github.com/intel-analytics/ipex-llm/blob/main/docs/mddocs/Quickstart/install_windows_gpu.md#install-prerequisites) to update GPU driver (optional) and install Conda.

If you are a Linux user, visit the [Install IPEX-LLM on Linux with Intel GPU](https://github.com/intel-analytics/ipex-llm/blob/main/docs/mddocs/Quickstart/install_linux_gpu.md), and follow [**Install Prerequisites**](https://github.com/intel-analytics/ipex-llm/blob/main/docs/mddocs/Quickstart/install_linux_gpu.md#install-prerequisites) to install GPU driver, Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit 2024.0, and Conda.

### Setup

After the prerequisites installation, you should have created a conda environment with all prerequisites installed. **Start the jupyter service in this conda environment**:
"""
logger.info("# IPEX-LLM")

# %pip install -qU langchain langchain-community

"""
Install IEPX-LLM for running LLMs locally on Intel GPU.

# %pip install --pre --upgrade ipex-llm[xpu] --extra-index-url https://pytorch-extension.intel.com/release-whl/stable/xpu/us/

"""
> **Note**
>
> You can also use `https://pytorch-extension.intel.com/release-whl/stable/xpu/cn/` as the extra-indel-url.

### Runtime Configuration

For optimal performance, it is recommended to set several environment variables based on your device:

#### For Windows Users with Intel Core Ultra integrated GPU

logger.info("### Runtime Configuration")


os.environ["SYCL_CACHE_PERSISTENT"] = "1"
os.environ["BIGDL_LLM_XMX_DISABLED"] = "1"

"""
> **Note**
>
> For the first time that each model runs on Intel iGPU/Intel Arc A300-Series or Pro A60, it may take several minutes to compile.
>
> For other GPU type, please refer to [here](https://github.com/intel-analytics/ipex-llm/blob/main/docs/mddocs/Overview/install_gpu.md#runtime-configuration) for Windows users, and  [here](https://github.com/intel-analytics/ipex-llm/blob/main/docs/mddocs/Overview/install_gpu.md#runtime-configuration-1) for Linux users.

### Save/Load Low-bit Model
Alternatively, you might save the low-bit model to disk once and use `from_model_id_low_bit` instead of `from_model_id` to reload it for later use - even across different machines. It is space-efficient, as the low-bit model demands significantly less disk space than the original model. And `from_model_id_low_bit` is also more efficient than `from_model_id` in terms of speed and memory usage, as it skips the model conversion step.
