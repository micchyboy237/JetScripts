title: Evaluating Your Summarizer
sidebar_label: Evaluate Your Summarizer
---

In the previous section, we built a meeting summarization agent that:

- Generates summaries
- Generates action items

To evaluate an LLM application like a summarization agent, we'll use single-turn [`LLMTestCase`](https://deepeval.com/docs/evaluation-test-cases)s from `deepeval`

![Single-turn LLM Test Case](https://deepeval-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/docs:llm-test-case.png)

Our summarization agent is a single-turn LLM application. That means we supply a transcript as `input`, the agent generates a summary and a list of action items as output. In code, such unit interactions are represented by an `LLMTestCase`:
"""
logger.info("id: evaluation")


test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input="...", # Your transcript
    actual_output="..." # The summary or action items
)

"""
:::tip
In our case, the summarization agent creates two seperate LLM calls. 

1. To generate summary
2. To generate action items

As this is a special case, we will be creating 2 test cases for a single `summarize()` call from our summarizer. This means the `LLMTestCase`s can and must be tailored to your application's specific needs.
:::

## Setup Testing Enviroment

For evaluating a summarization agent like ours, there is one main approach we can use:

- **Use Datasets** - Pull transcripts of previous meetings from a database or dataset. Since you're building a meeting summarizer, you might already have meeting transcripts that you want to summarize. You can store these transcripts in a database and retrieve them anytime to evaluate your summarizer.

### Datasets

Having to maintain a database to store meeting transcripts might not be feasible and accessing them everytime may also prove to be hard. In such cases, we can use `deepeval`'s [datasets](https://deepeval.com/docs/evaluation-datasets).
They are simply a collection of `Golden`s that can be stored in cloud and pulled anytime with just a few lines of code. They allow you to create test cases during run time by calling your LLM.

![Evaluation Dataset](https://deepeval-docs.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/docs:evaluation-dataset.png)

<details>
<summary><strong>Click here to learn about <code>Golden</code> in DeepEval</strong></summary>

A dataset can only be created with a list of goldens. `Golden`s represent a more flexible alternative to test cases in the `deepeval`, and **it is the preferred way to initialize a dataset using goldens**. Unlike test cases, `Golden`s:

- Don't require an `actual_output` when created
- Store expected results like `expected_output` and `expected_tools`
- Serve as templates before becoming fully-formed test cases

</details>

### Creating Goldens

We can create a dataset that contains numerous goldens each corresponding to different meeting transcripts represented as `input`s which can later be used to create `LLMTestCase`s during runtime by calling and filling `actual_output`s. Here's how you can create those goldens by looping over transcripts in a folder:
"""
logger.info("## Setup Testing Enviroment")


documents_path = "path/to/documents/folder"
transcripts = []

for document in os.listdir(documents_path):
    if document.endswith(".txt"):
        file_path = os.path.join(documents_path, document)
        with open(file_path, "r") as file:
            transcript = file.read().strip()
        transcripts.append(transcript)

goldens = []
for transcript in transcripts:
    golden = Golden(
        input=transcript
    )
    goldens.append(golden)

"""
You can sanity check your goldens as shown below:
"""
logger.info("You can sanity check your goldens as shown below:")

for i, golden in enumerate(goldens):
    logger.debug(f"Golden {i}: ", golden.input[:20])

"""
We can use the above created goldens to initialize a dataset and store it in cloud. Here's how you can do that:
"""
logger.info("We can use the above created goldens to initialize a dataset and store it in cloud. Here's how you can do that:")


dataset = EvaluationDataset(goldens=goldens)
dataset.push(alias="MeetingSummarizer Dataset")

"""
âœ… Done. We can now move on to creating test cases using this dataset.

### Creating Test Cases 

We will now call our summarization agent on the dataset `input`s and create our `LLMTestCase`s that we can use to evaluate our agent. Since our summarization agent returns summary and action items seperately, we will create 2 test cases for 1 `summarize()` call.

Here's how we can pull our dataset and create test cases:
"""
logger.info("### Creating Test Cases")


dataset = EvaluationDataset()
dataset.pull(alias="MeetingSummarizer Dataset")

summarizer = MeetingSummarizer() # Initialize with your best config
summary_test_cases = []
action_item_test_cases = []
for golden in dataset.goldens:
    summary, action_items = summarizer.summarize(golden.input)
    summary_test_case = LLMTestCase(
        input=golden.input,
        actual_output=summary
    )
    action_item_test_case = LLMTestCase(
        input=golden.input,
        actual_output=str(action_items)
    )
    summary_test_cases.append(summary_test_case)
    action_item_test_cases.append(action_item_test_case)

"""
âœ… Done. We now need to create our metrics to run evaluations on these test cases.

## Creating Metrics

Generally LLM applications are evaluated on 1-2 generic criteria and 1-2 use-case specific criteria. The summarization agent we've created processes meeting transcripts and generates a concise summary of the meeting and a list of action items. 
A generic criteria might not prove as useful on this application. So we'll be going with 2 use case specific criteria:

- **The summaries generated must be concise and contain all important points**
- **The action items generated must be correct and cover all the key actions**

From the criterion that we have defined above, both of them are custom criteria that exist only for our use case. Hence, we'll be using a custom metric:

- [G-Eval](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-llm-evals)

:::note 
`GEval` is a metric that uses _LLM-as-a-judge_ to evaluate LLM outputs based on **ANY** custom criteria. The `GEval` metric is the most versatile type of metric `deepeval` has to offer, and is capable of evaluating almost any use case.
:::

### Summary Concision

We will create a custom G-Eval metric with the above defined criteria for summaries generated to be concise. Here's how we can do that:
"""
logger.info("## Creating Metrics")


summary_concision = GEval(
    name="Summary Concision",
    criteria="Assess whether the summary is concise and focused only on the essential points of the meeting? It should avoid repetition, irrelevant details, and unnecessary elaboration.",
    threshold=0.9,
    evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.INPUT, LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT]
)

"""
### Action Items Check

We will create a custom metric to check the action items generated. Here's how we can do that:
"""
logger.info("### Action Items Check")


action_item_check = GEval(
    name="Action Item Accuracy",
    criteria="Are the action items accurate, complete, and clearly reflect the key tasks or follow-ups mentioned in the meeting?",
    threshold=0.9,
    evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.INPUT, LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT]
)

"""
Under-the-hood, the `GEval` metric uses _LLM-as-a-judge_ with chain-of-thoughts (CoT) to evaluate LLM outputs based on ANY custom criteria.

## Running Evals

We can now use the test cases and metrics we created to run our evaluations. Here's how we can run our first eval:

### Summary Eval

Since we created seperate metrics and seperate test cases for our summarizer, we'll first evaluate the summary concision:
"""
logger.info("## Running Evals")


evaluate(
    test_cases=summary_test_cases,
    metrics=[summary_concision]
)

"""
### Action Item Eval

We can run a seperate evaluation for action items generated as shown below:
"""
logger.info("### Action Item Eval")


evaluate(
    test_cases=action_item_test_cases,
    metrics=[action_item_check]
)

"""
ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥³ Congratulations! You've successfully learnt how to evaluate an LLM application. In this example we've successfully learnt how to:

- Create test cases for our summarization agent and evaluate it using `deepeval`
- Create datasets to store your inputs and use them anytime to generate test cases on-the-fly during run time

You can also run `deepeval view` to see the results of evals on Confident AI:

![Eval results for summarizer](https://deepeval-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/tutorials:summarization-agent:eval-results.png)

### Evaluation Results

**DeepEval**'s metrics provide a reason for their evaluation of a test case, which allows you to debug your LLM application easily on why certain test cases pass or fail. Below is one of the reasons from a failed test case provided by `deepeval`'s `GEval` for the above evaluations:

For summary:


> The Actual Output effectively identifies the key points of the meeting, covering the issues with the assistant's performance, the comparison between GPT-4o and Claude 3, the proposed hybrid approach, and the discussion around confidence metrics and tone. It omits extraneous details and is significantly shorter than the Input transcript. There's minimal repetition. However, while concise, it could be *slightly* more reduced; some phrasing feels unnecessarily verbose for a summary (e.g., 'Ethan and Maya discussed... focusing on concerns').

For action items: 

> The Actual Output captures some key action items discussed in the Input, specifically Maya building the similarity metric and setting up the hybrid model test, and Ethan syncing with design. However, it misses several follow-ups, such as exploring 8-bit embedding quantization and addressing the robotic tone of the assistant via prompt tuning. While the listed actions are clear and accurate, the completeness is lacking. The action items directly correspond to tasks mentioned, but not all tasks are represented.

:::info
It is advised to use a good evaluation model for better results and reasons. Your evaluation model should be well-suited for the task it's evaluating.
Some models like `gpt-4`, `gpt-4o`, `gpt-3.5-turbo` and `claude-3-opus` are best for summarization evaluations.
:::

In the next section, we'll see how we can improve our summarization agent using the evaluation results from `deepeval`
