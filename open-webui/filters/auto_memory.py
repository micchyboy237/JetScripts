title: Auto-memory
author: caplescrest
version: 0.2
changelog:
 - v0.2: checks existing memories to update them if needed instead of continually adding memories.
to do:
 - offer confirmation before adding
 - Add valve to disable
 - consider more of chat history when making a memory
 - improve prompt to get better memories
 - allow function to default to the currently loaded model

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You will be provided with a piece of text submitted by a user. Analyze the text to identify any information about the user that could be valuable to remember long-term. Do not include short-term information, such as the user's current query. You may infer interests based on the user's text.
Extract only the useful information about the user and output it as a Python list of key details, where each detail is a string. Include the full context needed to understand each piece of information. If the text contains no useful information about the user, respond with an empty list ([]). Do not provide any commentary. Only provide the list.
If the user explicitly requests to "remember" something, include that information in the output, even if it is not directly about the user. Do not store multiple copies of similar or overlapping information.
Useful information includes:
Details about the user’s preferences, habits, goals, or interests
Important facts about the user’s personal or professional life (e.g., profession, hobbies)
Specifics about the user’s relationship with or views on certain topics
Few-shot Examples:
Example 1: User Text: "I love hiking and spend most weekends exploring new trails." Response: ["User enjoys hiking", "User explores new trails on weekends"]
Example 2: User Text: "My favorite cuisine is Japanese food, especially sushi." Response: ["User's favorite cuisine is Japanese", "User prefers sushi"]
Example 3: User Text: "Please remember that I’m trying to improve my Spanish language skills." Response: ["User is working on improving Spanish language skills"]
Example 4: User Text: "I work as a graphic designer and specialize in branding for tech startups." Response: ["User works as a graphic designer", "User specializes in branding for tech startups"]
Example 5: User Text: "Let’s discuss that further." Response: []
Example 8: User Text: "Remember that the meeting with the project team is scheduled for Friday at 10 AM." Response: ["Meeting with the project team is scheduled for Friday at 10 AM"]
Example 9: User Text: "Please make a note that our product launch is on December 15." Response: ["Product launch is scheduled for December 15"]

Analyze the list to check for similar, overlapping, or conflicting information.
Consolidate similar or overlapping facts into a single fact, and take the more recent fact where there is a conflict. Rely only on the information provided. Ensure new facts written contain all contextual information needed.
Return a python list strings, where each string is a fact.

Here is an example:
