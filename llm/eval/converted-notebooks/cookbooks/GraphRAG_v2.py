# GraphRAG Implementation with LlamaIndex - V2
#
# [GraphRAG (Graphs + Retrieval Augmented Generation)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/graphrag/) combines the strengths of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Query-Focused Summarization (QFS) to effectively handle complex queries over large text datasets. While RAG excels in fetching precise information, it struggles with broader queries that require thematic understanding, a challenge that QFS addresses but cannot scale well. GraphRAG integrates these approaches to offer responsive and thorough querying capabilities across extensive, diverse text corpora.
#
# This notebook provides guidance on constructing the GraphRAG pipeline using the LlamaIndex PropertyGraph abstractions using Neo4J.
#
# This notebook updates the GraphRAG pipeline to v2. If you haven’t checked v1 yet, you can find it [here](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/blob/main/docs/docs/examples/cookbooks/GraphRAG_v1.ipynb). Following are the updates to the existing implementation:
#
# 1. Integrate with Neo4J Graph database.
# 2. Embedding based retrieval.
#

# Installation
#
# `graspologic` is used to use hierarchical_leiden for building communities.

# !pip install llama-index llama-index-graph-stores-neo4j graspologic numpy==1.24.4 scipy==1.12.0 future

# Load Data
#
# We will use a sample news article dataset retrieved from Diffbot, which Tomaz has conveniently made available on GitHub for easy access.
#
# The dataset contains 2,500 samples; for ease of experimentation, we will use 50 of these samples, which include the `title` and `text` of news articles.


news = pd.read_csv(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomasonjo/blog-datasets/main/news_articles.csv"
)[:50]

news.head()

# Prepare documents as required by LlamaIndex

documents = [
    Document(text=f"{row['title']}: {row['text']}")
    for i, row in news.iterrows()
]

# Setup API Key and LLM


# os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-.."


llm = Ollama(model="llama3.1", request_timeout=300.0, context_window=4096)

# GraphRAGExtractor
#
# The GraphRAGExtractor class is designed to extract triples (subject-relation-object) from text and enrich them by adding descriptions for entities and relationships to their properties using an LLM.
#
# This functionality is similar to that of the `SimpleLLMPathExtractor`, but includes additional enhancements to handle entity, relationship descriptions. For guidance on implementation, you may look at similar existing [extractors](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/examples/property_graph/Dynamic_KG_Extraction/?h=comparing).
#
# Here's a breakdown of its functionality:
#
# **Key Components:**
#
# 1. `llm:` The language model used for extraction.
# 2. `extract_prompt:` A prompt template used to guide the LLM in extracting information.
# 3. `parse_fn:` A function to parse the LLM's output into structured data.
# 4. `max_paths_per_chunk:` Limits the number of triples extracted per text chunk.
# 5. `num_workers:` For parallel processing of multiple text nodes.
#
#
# **Main Methods:**
#
# 1. `__call__:` The entry point for processing a list of text nodes.
# 2. `acall:` An asynchronous version of __call__ for improved performance.
# 3. `_aextract:` The core method that processes each individual node.
#
#
# **Extraction Process:**
#
# For each input node (chunk of text):
# 1. It sends the text to the LLM along with the extraction prompt.
# 2. The LLM's response is parsed to extract entities, relationships, descriptions for entities and relations.
# 3. Entities are converted into EntityNode objects. Entity description is stored in metadata
# 4. Relationships are converted into Relation objects. Relationship description is stored in metadata.
# 5. These are added to the node's metadata under KG_NODES_KEY and KG_RELATIONS_KEY.
#
# **NOTE:** In the current implementation, we are using only relationship descriptions. In the next implementation, we will utilize entity descriptions during the retrieval stage.

# Docker Setup And Neo4J setup
#
# To launch Neo4j locally, first ensure you have docker installed. Then, you can launch the database with the following docker command.
#
# ```
# docker run \
#     -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 \
#     -v $PWD/data:/data -v $PWD/plugins:/plugins \
#     --name neo4j-apoc \
#     -e NEO4J_apoc_export_file_enabled=true \
#     -e NEO4J_apoc_import_file_enabled=true \
#     -e NEO4J_apoc_import_file_use__neo4j__config=true \
#     -e NEO4JLABS_PLUGINS=\[\"apoc\"\] \
#     neo4j:latest
# ```
# From here, you can open the db at http://localhost:7474/. On this page, you will be asked to sign in. Use the default username/password of neo4j and neo4j.
#
# Once you login for the first time, you will be asked to change the password.
